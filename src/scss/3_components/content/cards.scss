// Cards.
//
// Cards organise information into meaningful and distinct blocks of content. They are called "cards" because they are
// often designed to look like real-world tangible cards in user interfaces (think of trump cards, business cards, or
// even post-it notes). A card gathers snippets of information about a "thing" to serve as an entry point to more
// detailed information about that "thing".  Cards often contain an image, a heading, a short description or "teaser
// text" and the entire card can act as a link or contain a link (or links) to view more detailed information.
